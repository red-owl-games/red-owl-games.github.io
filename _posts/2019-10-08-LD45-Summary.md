Theme: Start with Nothing

Outcome: Pretty great considering we had both kids the entire 72 hours!

##Friday

We're motivated.  We're ready.  We're happy with our brainstorming efforts.  Let's do this!

__Start with Nothing__  Seriously??  That's the theme.  But that applies to basically 95% of the games that exist.  So I guess that's good and bad because we could pretty much make any game we want?  At least the theme wasn't **Factory**.

Once we go over the initial shock of the blase theme, we pick the basic game we were going to make.  

Grow a tree from a seed into a large tree.  Initially, this game was in the **Evolution** theme of brainstorming.  The idea was going to be start with a seed, grow the tree, pick a mutation, evole, grow, repeat and eventually see if you can survive some sort of event - drought, hurricane, nuclear attack, etc.  That was way more than we needed for this theme, so we decided to just start as a seed underground (nothing) and grow into a nice big tree.  We had a lot of discussion around what would make growing a tree a fun game.  I didn't believe it could be but @rocktavious convinced me that we should make the game an experience and leverage off of his art skills and my new found music skills.

And Cultivation was born.

@Rocktavious was sure we should programatically generate the tree branches to make it a better game.  I thought it was overkill for a game jam.  I went to bed around 9pm with a plan to start our design doc and task list in the morning.  @Rocktavious stayed up until midnight working on programatic branch generation.


##Saturday

We wake up, play with the kids, eat some cereal for breakfast.  Of course, Oliver insisted on pouring his own.  We chat about more game ideas while eating.  Head upstairs, get dressed, chat some more.  Then it's off to Home Depot to get our First Saturday Kid's Project.  If you don't know about this, the first Saturday of every month Home Depot hosts a FREE kid's project.  Kid's can even get FREE orange Home Depot aprons.  You can do the project there or just walk in and grab and project to complete at home.  Honestly, it gets pretty crazy busy (@rocktavious had to work on the floor once) so we just do the projects at home now.

I took my computer along to finish up the task list and we filled in some tasks, priority levels and assignees while driving to and from Home Depot.  Then on the way home we stopped to grab some Starbucks and KC Donuts.  They have **the best** giant donut holes.  We even got one filled with cream for Oliver.  They fill their donuts on the spot.  So good. 

Since Kyle had some more work to do on the programatic tree branching I took the kids most of the morning while he worked on getting that going.  Since branching is the heart of a tree growing game, it was basically our highest priority to get done.  While he did that, I put Annette down for a nap and Oliver and I made this awesome felt cat!

We ate a snack lunch, played with the kids while we caught up on what Kyle had been working on and then put the kids down for a nap.  We planned for nap time to be our most productive time since it was the only time both kids would be sleeping at the same time so we could both work simultaneously.  Luckily, both our kids take nice strong afternoon naps so we were sure to get 2-4 hours solid.  

I was able to sit down and write most of our music layers.  Since this game was about the experience, we had decided that the music should basically be written as layers.  It was going to start nice and slow, sparse and slowly add layers.  Instruments, notes, melodies.  So over the course of the nap, I was able to get most of the tracks down in FL Studio.  In the short amoutn of time I've been composing music, I've leaned how helpful it is to step away from what you're writing for a while and come back to it later.  The kids both work up st almost the prefect time for me to step away and let the music sink in.  I wanted to finish up a couple things before I stopped music development with the plan to add 1-2 more tracks/layers and mix the music next.  Then, I'd be moving the composition into FMOD to hook up parameters so we could programtically modify the music within the game.

@Rocktavious took this nap time to perfect his branching logic even more.  <what else?

So, kids are up, I'm working on some things, @rocktvious changes Annette's diaper.  Our kids have super sensitive skin so we generally let them hang out naked for ~10 minutes before putting on a new diaper.  @Rocktavious and I are talking about the music and layers I've written while we listen to it.  Oliver starts complaining about something.  He keeps complaining.  We turn around.  Annette has pooped on the carpet, Oliver has stepped in it and tried to wipe it off with his hands.  We go into problem mode.  @Rocktavious take Annette to wash her off in teh tub, I grab Oliver and shower him down.  Proceed to clean the poop off the carpet, the couch, and under the couch.  You know what? A 72 hour game jame with 2 kids under 4 is tough!  But on the plus side, the music and layers were looping this whole time and we found it was pretty relazing and not annoying so that was good!

Our day moves on.  We eat dinner.  I take the kids again while @rocktavious is feeling defeated by his three attempts at a branch growing system.  We all head to bed early (seriously, 8:30pm).


##Sunday

- bit of morning work before annette cried for breakfast
- used new beans for coffee - oily but good
- i played with kids outside while kyle perfected tree growth
- Kyle decided to just move forward past the tree growth system and started getting the rest of the game setup (made really good progress)
- painted tow truck and scarecrow
- annette napped and i worked more on music - got to where i needed to put it into FMOD - how do that again
- Hit a performance cap (instantiating too many objects at one time when the tree is large)
- went out to dinner, went to 2 parks with kids
- glued and nailed tow truck and scarecrow

##Monday

- worked on art while kids played outside
- set up halloween decorations
- set up [itch.io](http://itch.io) and game page framework
- kyle finished up tow truck and scarecrow projects while i worked on music - also played some civilization
    - gave up on bug and just tweaked music to skip a parameter setting
- kids napped
    - i did webgl build and tested game on site - it failed because of FMOD, essentially
    - kyle added artwork then debugged webgl issues and FMOD
    - I added some about us screens and tweaked colors
    - got us waters
    - annette tried to wake up at 230 but went back to sleep
    - turns out the bug was in unity, once uploaded it worked fine...
- publish with 15 min 29 seconds to spare

##Things to Fix

Github Actions Build System

Auto Upload to itch.io

Document Aspect Ratios (WebGL 960 x 600 - 975 x 615 [itch.io](http://itch.io) frame)

FMOD integration code

FMOD in RedOwl external lib

SyncAddressable don't work in WebGL - needs fallback
