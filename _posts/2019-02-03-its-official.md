When we first met, @rocktavious had a dream.  A dream to have his own game studio.  That was back in 2012.  Since then, he’s left the games industry, we’ve gotten married and had two kids, I left the workforce entirely and he’s never lost sight of his dream.  Then, a few months after our daughter was born, I lamented being out of the workforce and we agreed to get started with this company @rocktavious had been dreaming about.  

Video games were not something I grew up playing.  They’re not something I ever imagined I would make.  But as time goes by, I play more games and have fun dreaming up the games I could be playing with my husband and one day, when they’re old enough, my kids.  So I agreed to give this game development idea a shot.  After all, I come from a technical background so that gives me a bit of a head start into understanding what’s going on.

So in January 2019 we began to form Red Owl LLC.  At first it seemed to be pretty straightforward.  Then I started to look more into it.  I should know from writing software at my previous job that interacted with the IRS that nothing involving the IRS is easy!  Silly me.  So between naps and after bedtime, I took on a lot of the administrative tasks to for our LLC.  After a few weeks, some paperwork, and wading through some IRS docs, everything fell into place.

As of February 3rd, 2019, Red Owl LLC has arrived!  I can’t wait to see what we can create together and where this journey will take us.
