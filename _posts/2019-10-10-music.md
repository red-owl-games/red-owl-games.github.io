I can code.  @rocktavious can code.  Over the summer I had an epiphany.  @rocktavious likes, no loves, to code.  So much more than I do.  Don't get me wrong, I in no way hate it.  I even like it!  But I just don't have quite the level of passion that @rocktavious does.  So it really doesn't make sense for me to be taking the lead on coding.  Especially when Red Owl Games started as @rocktavious' dream.  @rocktavious should be taking the lead on the piece of it he is the most passionate about.  But what does that leave me with?  There's still game design that I was going to be taking the lead on all along.  And then there's art and music.  And course playtesting - but that's an entire other ball game.

@rocktavious literally graduated from the [Academy of Art](https://www.academyart.edu/) so it makes sense for him to keep the lead on art.  And I have more experience with music than he does anyways.  Granted that experience is playing the french horn through high school.  But experience is experience right?  So the decision was made for me to take the lead on music.

Decision made.  Now what?  I've never written music so let's start there!  An hour online searching and poking around reveals a course that looks pretty good, is targeted at game dev and has great reviews.  [Game Music Composition: Make Music For Games From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/gamemusiccourse/) on Udemy was where I decided to start my music journey.

The course was great.  Honestly, it's the first of many many online courses I completely finished.  As a result of the course, Red Owl Games expanded it's toolbox with [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/) and [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/).

Here's the first composition I wrote for the course:

And here's one of the last:

I think it's a pretty great improvement.  I also utilized my new found skills and [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) to write all the music for our Ludum Dare 45 submission, [Cultivation](https://redowlgames.com/project/ld45), as well.  I think the course was worth all $9.99!

So, I'm taking the lead on music now and enjoying it quite a bit!  But I'm going to keep expanding my skill set so I can help @rocktavious out with some artwork as well.  So, I'm going to take the Unity class [Beginner Art: Unity Game Dev Course](https://learn.unity.com/course/unity-game-development-course-beginner-art).  Hopefully it goes as well as the music course!
