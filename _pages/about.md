We are a husband and wife indie studio balancing life with two kids, work, developing games we're proud of and enjoying life along the way.

## Meet @emmy-oop

I'm a mother, a photographer and a mathematician.  I'm not who I thought I would be growing up.  But I'm really happy with where I am.  I'm excited to start this journey with @rocktavious and see what we can create together.  

I'm new to game development and am working to catch up with @rocktavious.  Unity makes things relatively easy to get going which has made the process a lot of fun.  I'm bringing my own skills from a past life to the team as well.  I have to say, I do love a good todo list!
