We are a husband and wife indie game studio balancing life with two kids, work, developing games we're proud of and enjoying life along the way.

#### CFO / Designer / Engineer / Bug Hunter

I'm a mother, a photographer and a mathematician.  I'm not who I thought I would be growing up.  But I'm really happy with where I am.  I'm excited to start this journey with @rocktavious and see what we can create together.  

I'm new to game development and am working to catch up with @rocktavious.  Unity makes things relatively easy to get going which has made the process a lot of fun.  I'm bringing my own skills from a past life to the team as well.  I have to say, I do love a good todo list!

#### CTO / Artist / Designer / Tester

I got my first job in the games industry back in 2009. Since then, I've worked for serveral studios (Lightbox Interactive & Cloud Imperium Games), but starting a family of my own caused me to look for something a little more stable and family friendly.  So I jumped over to the software industry where I've worked at Under Armour for the past 5 years.  Together all of these experiences have added to my understanding of how to run a successful business of any size.

Running a video game studio has been a longtime dream of mine.  Since I got my first job in the games industry I've wanted to learn everything, not just how the game development process works, but also how a successful business runs.  I want to make a place where people are proud of the work they do but not killing themselves in the process.

I'm incredibly excited that @emmy-oop has decided to come with me on this journey.  I see great potential in what we could bring to all of you and I also hope you will enjoy it!
